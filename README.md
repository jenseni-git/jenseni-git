- G'day. I'm @jenseni-git. I'm currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Queensland.
- I have particular interests in JavaScript and Java but have also used Python, C, as well as various other frameworks in the past.
  - In the future, I am looking to learn C++, and extend my knowledge of React and NextJS
